<h1> What is Golden retriever </h1>
<strong>Golden Retriever is a breed of dog and is native to Scotland, UK.
It gives a muscular body a healthy and refreshing feel. It has golden shiny hair,
the inner hair is waterproof and the outer hair is elastic.
They were trained to find the prey they caught.
The outer and inner hairs protect the body from cold and water,
so they come to bite the prey in the water. You can swim well,
smell well and train easily. Although it is large,
it can be raised in the house by covering the urine.
You just need to manage your weight during the growing season so you don't get too fat.
 It is a long haired dog, but it is a very hard-haired dog.</strong></p>
